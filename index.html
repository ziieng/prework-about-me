      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hi friends, hello! I'm excited to be here and learn a new skillset for a new career.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Fort Worth, Texas</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Playing video games, scrolling Tumblr, and baking (thanks, Corona)</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Something that's challenging enough to be interesting long-term, and provides a sense of stability.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Bremerton, WA (luckily, near the ferry terminal.)</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I enjoy building things and solving the puzzles that crop up for troubleshooting them. If this is a way to make a career out of what I've been doing to keep busy at my day job, then why not?</p>
